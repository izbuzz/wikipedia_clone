		    Doom is a first-person shooter game developed and
		    self-published by id Software. Released on December 10,
		    1993, for DOS, it is the first installment in the Doom
		    franchise. The player assumes the role of a space
		    marine, popularly known as the Doomguy, fighting his
		    way through hordes of invading demons in military bases
		    on the moons of Mars and in hell. The player traverses
		    levels to find an exit to the next level or kill a
		    final boss, while fighting demons and possessed undead
		    humans. <br>
		    <br>
		    Doom was the third major independent release by id
		    Software, after Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and the Commander
		    Keen series of episodes (1990–1991). In May 1992, id
		    started developing the game as around the concept of
		    using technology to fight demons, which would use the
		    fast 3D game engine being developed by John Carmack and
		    would have a darker style than Wolfenstein 3D or
		    Commander Keen. Initially intended to have a science
		    fiction plot by designer Tom Hall, the final game,
		    designed by John Romero and Sandy Petersen, is a
		    fast-paced action game with a limited plot. The game
		    was self-published by id as a set of three episodes
		    under the shareware model, in which the first episode
		    is released for free to drive interest in paying for
		    the rest. A retail version with an additional episode
		    was published in 1995 by GT Interactive as The Ultimate
		    Doom...

		<img src="images/bomber.jpg" class="float">
		The bombing of Hamburg in World War II by the Allies included
		numerous attacks on German civilians and civic infrastructure. As a
		large city and industrial centre, Hamburg's shipyards, U-boat pens
		and oil refineries were attacked throughout the war. In late July
		1943, as part of a campaign of strategic bombing, the Allies
		launched Operation Gomorrah, an eight-day bombing campaign in
		Hamburg. In particular, during the 27/28 July raid carried out by
		the Royal Air Force (RAF), concentrated bombing created one of the
		largest firestorms of the war. Operation Gomorrah killed an
		estimated 37,000 people and destroyed 60% of the city's houses. An
		unexpected consequence of the raid was the reallocation of some
		German resources away from the fighting fronts. Large numbers of
		anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft were redeployed back to
		Germany, so aiding the Allies in their conduct of the ground war.

		This United States propaganda newsreel (above), released in August
		1943, covers the Eighth Air Force's bombing of Hamburg during
		Operation Gomorrah. The newsreel's narrator states that Hamburg is
		"Germany's principal seaport and number-one war center" and that
		the bombing caused "devastation of war plants", but does not
		mention the deliberate destruction of entire residential
		neighborhoods. The intent was to reduce German industrial
		production for the war effort by making workers homeless – an
		opinion based on study of the effect on British factories of German
		bombing during the Blitz.

		This aerial photograph (below), taken by an RAF officer, shows part
		of the Hamburg district of Eilbek after this dehousing campaign; it
		was probably taken after the end of the war and certainly after
		rubble and other debris had been cleared.
